                <h3>Vehicle Position Simulation (programmed in C++)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This program was done as a project for my computer programming in engineering
                            applications II class. This program takes several inputs, primarily direction
                            and velocity, in order to simulate the position and state of a moving car. 
                            This program is a great representation of my ability to use object oriented 
                            programming and create a program which can vary greatly depending on the input data.

                <h3>Solar Tracker (programmed in Java)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In this project I worked within a group of 4 people in order to construct a device
                            that rotates a solar panel towards the sun in order for it to be of maximum 
                            effectiveness. I focused on programming the arduino to control the motor which
                            rotated the system. I did this by reading the change in voltage caused by the 
                            photoresistors as they were exposed to more or less light. I then programmed the 
                            motor to rotate accordingly in the direction which was determined to be of greater sunlight.

                <h3>Alien Invasion Game (programmed in Python)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This program was done as a project for my introduction to software engineering 
                        class. It is a game that is very similar to galaga with various moving entities as 
                        well as a score counting system. This program displays my ability to code using 
                        object oriented programming.

                        applications class. It is a fully funtional text-based Uno game. It is a great display
                            of my ability to manage dynamicallly allocated data through the use of linked lists.
