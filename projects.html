                <h3>Tic Tac Toe (programmed in Python)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This Tic Tac Toe game was a personal project of mine. I wanted to create a game with
                        a graphical user interface to play it on. I also wanted to experiment with creating
                        a sort of AI that would make smart decisions based on the previous and currently available
                        moves. Thus, I created this Tic Tac Toe game using python. In addition to my goals with this
                        project, I got to practice writing code in a more object oriented way, and I was able to
                        expose myself to a new python module in tkinter.

                <ul>
                    <li>This program was done as a project for my computer programming in engineering
                            applications II class. This program takes several inputs, primarily direction
                            and velocity, in order to simulate the position and state of a moving car. 
                            This program is a great representation of my ability to use object oriented 
                            programming and create a program which can vary greatly depending on the input data.

                <h3>Solar Tracker (programmed in Java)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In this project I worked within a group of 4 people in order to construct a device
                            that rotates a solar panel towards the sun in order for it to be of maximum 
                            effectiveness. I focused on programming the arduino to control the motor which
                            rotated the system. I did this by reading the change in voltage caused by the 
                            photoresistors as they were exposed to more or less light. I then programmed the 
                            motor to rotate accordingly in the direction which was determined to be of greater sunlight.

                    <li>This program was done as a project for my introduction to software engineering 
                        class. It is a game that is very similar to galaga with various moving entities as 
                        well as a score counting system. This program displays my ability to code using 
                        object oriented programming.

                            of my ability to manage dynamicallly allocated data through the use of linked lists.
