# Personal-Website
This website is a personal project of mine. I made it using a combination of html 
and css. I wanted to start working on some more frontend type of programming work and this project
was a great start towards that goal. I initially had lots of difficulty organizing the website the 
way I wanted it, but once I better understood how to use flexbox to align, organize, and group different
content I was able to successfully create the website how I wanted.
