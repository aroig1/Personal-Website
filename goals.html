                <h2>My 10 Year Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    In 10 years, I see myself managing a software engineering team at a larger company.
                    After completing my bachelor's degree while achieving the Dean's list for all 4 
                    years, I plan on joining a tech cocmpany where I will work within the software
                    department. After gaining experience as a developer, I want to work my way up 
                    into a management position where I will oversee larger projects. I know I'd be a 
                    good fit in management because I am a natural leader in projects as I am proficient
                    at strategizing the best and most efficient way to complete a task. Even in 
                    difficult moments, my work ethic helps me to perservere through any problems and 
                    ultimately come up successful. I also want to work within management because it 
                    will allow me to work with multiple different engineering disciplines and I believe
                        that it would be a fun challenge to properly integrate all the different groups 
                        into one working unit.
